Outside of the internet we have the same rights as our fellow americans. What are subs, I believe my theory is everyone are plebs. No copy paste please.

[23:57:42] <reallybreh2015> I really don't see what terrorism have to do with 9/11, it's quite obvious an example that airplanes simply cannot handle the combined weight of several americans. When a single american takes up most of the seats in a row it is quite obvious that putting several of them on a plane is a guaranteed flight risk, not to mention their mobility scooters in the luggage...
